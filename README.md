# iquaflow-airplane-yolov5-use-case

Airplanes object detection on different levels of image compression.

To request the dataset send an email to: iquaflow@satellogic.com.

Paper availabe [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.05892.pdf).

## To reproduce the experiments:

1. `git clone git@github.com:satellogic/iquaflow-airplane-yolov5-use-case`
2. `cd iquaflow-airplane-yolov5-use-case`
3. Then build the docker image with `make build`.(\*\*\*) This will also download the dataset and weights
4. In order to execute the experiments:
    - `make dockershell` (\*)
    - Inside the docker terminal execute `python ./iqf-usecase.py`
5. Start the mlflow server by doing `make mlflow` (\*)
6. Notebook examples can be launched and executed by `make notebookshell NB_PORT=[your_port]"` (\**)
7. To access the notebook from your browser in your local machine you can do:
    - If the executions are launched in a server, make a tunnel from your local machine. `ssh -N -f -L localhost:[your_port]:localhost:[your_port] [remote_user]@[remote_ip]`  Otherwise skip this step.
    - Then, in your browser, access: `localhost:[your_port]/?token=IQF`

## Notes

   - The results of the IQF experiment can be seen in the MLflow user interface.
   - For more information please check the IQF_expriment.ipynb or IQF_experiment.py.
   - There are also examples of dataset Sanity check and Stats in SateAirportsStats.ipynb
   - The default ports are `8888` for the notebookshell, `5000` for the mlflow and `9197` for the dockershell
   - (*)
        Additional optional arguments can be added. The dataset location is:
        >`DS_VOLUME=[path_to_your_dataset]`
   - To change the default port for the mlflow service:
     >`MLF_PORT=[your_port]`
   - (**)
        To change the default port for the notebook: 
        >`NB_PORT=[your_port]`
   - A terminal can also be launched by `make dockershell` with optional arguments such as (*)
   - (***)
        Depending on the version of your cuda drivers and your hardware you might need to change the version of pytorch which is in the Dockerfile where it says:
        >`pip3 install torch==1.7.0+cu110 torchvision==0.8.1+cu110 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html`.
   - (***)
        The dataset is downloaded with all the results of executing the dataset modifiers already generated. This allows the user to freely skip the `.execute` as well as the `apply_metric_per_run` which __take long time__.
